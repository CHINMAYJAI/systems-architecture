# Deadlock Handling

This repository contains implementations and algorithms related to deadlock handling in operating systems. It is a sub-repository of the [`operating_system`](https://github.com/CHINMAYJAI/operating_system) repository, which is under the [`system-architecture`](https://github.com/CHINMAYJAI/system-architecture) parent repository.

## Contents

- **Deadlock Detection**

## Overview

Deadlocks are a significant concern in operating systems where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource held by another process. This repository provides practical implementations of deadlock detection and avoidance algorithms to tackle such issues.

### Deadlock Detection

The deadlock detection program analyzes the state of the system to determine if a deadlock has occurred. By examining resource allocation and process states, it helps in identifying and resolving deadlocks efficiently.

### Banker's Algorithm

The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance strategy that tests for safe resource allocation states to prevent deadlocks. It simulates resource allocation for processes in a way that avoids unsafe states.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the `system-architecture` repository**:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHINMAYJAI/system-architecture.git
```

2. **Navigate to the `deadlock_handling` directory**:
```bash
   cd system-architecture/operating_system/deadlock_handling
```
3. **Run the Program**
- Deadlock Detection
```bash
# If the file is a Python script
python deadlock_detection.py
```

4. **Banker's Algorithm:**
```bash
# If the file is a Python script
python bankers_algorithm.py
```
Replace the file extensions and commands according to the programming language used (e.g., java, cpp, etc.).

5. **Follow the Instructions:**

- The programs may prompt for input such as the number of processes, resources, allocation matrices, etc.

- Input the required data as per the prompts to simulate deadlock detection and avoidance.
